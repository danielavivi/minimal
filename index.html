        <h2> PhD Economics Candidate </h2>

        <p>My name is Daniela Villacreces Villacis, and I am an aspiring PhD candidate in Economics with a strong focus on macroeconomic stability,   
          international trade, and development. My research has explored diverse topics, including the effects of public debt and investment on economic growth, 
          the role of manufacturing exports to developed countries in fostering export sophistication, and the welfare implications of fiscal policy rules in commodity-dependent economies.</p>
        <p>I graduated as the top student in my undergraduate program at King’s College London and I earned a complete scholarship to study an MSc in Economics for Development from the University 
          of Oxford, where I ranked among the top 5 students in my cohort. My academic journey reflects a commitment to rigorous analysis and a deep curiosity about the economic mechanisms that shape global and local outcomes.</p>
        <p>This website provides comprehensive information about my academic background, research experience, and PhD application materials. If you have any questions or would like to discuss my work, please don’t hesitate to reach out.</p>

 <h4>1.  From Macroeconomic Stability to Welfare:
         Optimizing Fiscal Rules in Commodity-Dependent Economies, Inter-American Development Bank, 2023.

<summary ><b>Abstract</b></summary>


<ul>
   
<li>We study the welfare and macroeconomic implications of simple and implementable fiscal policy rules in
    commodity-dependent economies, where a large share of output, exports, and government revenues depend on 
    exogenous and volatile commodity prices. Using a multisector New Keynesian model estimated for the Chilean economy,
    we find that the welfare-maximizing fiscal policy involves an actively countercyclical response to the tax revenue cycle. 
    In contrast, the optimized response to the commodity revenue cycle is procyclical, given the high persistence and
    the economic dynamics induced by international commodity price shocks. The optimized fiscal rules deliver significant 
    welfare gains of 0.52% of lifetime consumption for non-Ricardian consumers and 0.06% for Ricardian consumers relative to a 
    benchmark acyclical policy. Lump-sum social transfers are the best instrument to implement the fiscal rule, yielding higher welfare gains, 
    enabling reductions in macroeconomic volatility, and producing only moderate additional volatility in government spending.</li>

  <h4>2.	Learning by Trading: 
         The Virtuous Cycle of Manufactured Exports on Export Sophistication. MSc dissertation, University of Oxford, 2020.

<summary ><b>Abstract</b></summary>



 <p>This paper examines the role of trade-induced learning in driving export sophistication in developing countries, with a focus on how
    manufactured exports to developed countries (MXDC) catalyze further production of goods resembling those exported by advanced economies (sophisticated products). 
    Using panel data from 63 developing countries (1995–2018) and a two-step system GMM model, I find that prior MXDC significantly enhances current export sophistication.
    A 1\% increase in MXDC leads to a 5-percentage-point (p.p.) rise in export sophistication in the short term, with long-term gains exceeding 11 p.p. for countries with 
    median levels of trade openness and remoteness. The largest benefits are observed in remote economies with low trade openness, where reduced competition amplifies spillover 
    effects. Case studies of Mexico, Colombia, and China highlight the critical role of state-led industrial policies in leveraging MXDC for structural transformation and sustained
    economic development.</p>

  <h4>3.	An empirical investigation of the effects of public debt and public investment in human and physical capital on economic growth in Ecuador. BSc dissertation, King’s College London, 2019.
         
        <a href="https://konstantinpoensgen.github.io/pages/phd-economics-application-advice.html" target="_blank" style="color:rgb(180,60,60);">[Access paper here] </a> </h4>

<summary ><b>Abstract</b></summary>



<p>This paper investigates empirically the effects of total public debt and public investment in human and physical capital on the economic growth of Ecuador from 1990 to 2016.
    Two short-run autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) models, one on GDP growth and another one on private investments, are employed as part of this paper identification strategy.
    An error correction term is included in the GDP growth regression to control for the unidentified long-run relationship. A significant detrimental impact of public debt on economic
    growth was identified in the short and long-run. Besides, Ecuador was found to depend on public investment in physical capital in the long-run, given the limited contribution from the private sector.
    Unfortunately, this study could not conclusively determine the impact of public investment in human capital. This study concludes that Ecuador should adopt an open economy industrial strategy policy (OEIP) agenda, 
    aiming at enabling the contribution of the private sectors to total capital accumulation. Once the roles of public investment in physical capital has become complementary, the government could consider 
    a fiscal adjustment of the economy to reduce public debt.</p>
